Welcome to Git!

This is my first tracked file.
Git will track changes made to this file.

I will now add more lines to this file.
I will again take a "snapshot" of this file.

To save the changes to Git, I need to:



One more last commit on this file.

I will now change this one more time.

This was added on another day.
